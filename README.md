# SPARC Architecture and Compiler Design

##### Abstract
Present the architecture of a modern digital computer, its relationship to the Unix operating system and the C programming language. Understand the representation of high level languages in a form executable by such a computer and the underlying machine programming language and structure. The project will consider the C programming language, SPARC architecture, boolean logic, number systems, and computer arithmetic; macro assembly language programming and subroutine linkages; the operating system interface and input/output; understanding the output of the C compiler; the use of the C programming language to generate specific assembly language instructions.

##### Objective
Understand the architecture of a RISC machine, specifically a virtual Sun SPARCstation 5 workstation; C and assembly language programming; macros; the form of assembly language generated by a compiler; and the interface to an operating system.
