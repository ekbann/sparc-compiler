# SPARC Architecture and Compiler Design

##### Abstract
Present the architecture of a modern RISC digital computer circa 1996, its relationship to the Unix operating system and the C programming language. Understand the representation of high level languages in a form executable by such a computer and the underlying machine programming language and structure. The project will consider the C programming language, SPARC architecture, boolean logic, number systems, and computer arithmetic; macro assembly language programming and subroutine linkages; the operating system interface and input/output; understanding the output of the C compiler; the use of the C programming language to generate specific assembly language instructions.

##### Objective
Understand the architecture of a RISC machine, specifically a Sun SPARCstation 5 workstation; C and assembly language programming; the form of assembly language generated by a compiler; the interface to an operating system; and design a complete SPARC C compiler using flex and bison.

#### Design Notes
Summary of the important aspects of my compiler:

* All `external_decls` are assigned `modifier` type `EXTERN` unless specifically defined in the source code.
* I added a new debug directive, `debug(node_dump_on)` and its counterpart `debug(node_dump_off)`, which keeps track of the creation of new syntax tree nodes. The output format of a sample node is:

```   
    node_type: = [104576]
         left:   LEAF [106304]
        right:   NODE [104640]
```

The number in square brackets is a pointer to that specific node. At the end of parsing the source code, this directive outputs the pointer to the `ROOT` of the program syntax tree, e.g.

    `syntax tree root = [138368]`

This allows the user to manually reconstruct the syntax tree to verify if the syntax tree was constructed properly. Another simpler way is to use the directive `debug(statement_dump)`.

* The debug directive `debug(symtab_dump)` dumps the symbol table at the *current* context level. After the closing brace of a compound statement (see *CC.y* **statement** ) the compiler will delete the closing context level because those symbols are not required anymore.
