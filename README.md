##### Prerequisite
* Cse 110, or cse 121.

##### Description
Presentation of the architecture of a modern digital computer, its relationship to the Unix operating
system and the C programming language. The representation of high level languages in a form executable
by such a computer and the underlying machine programming language and structure. ,
The course will consider the C programming language, SPARC architecture, boolean logic, number
systems, and computer arithmetic; macro assembly language programming and subroutine linkages; the
operating system interface and input/output; understanding the output of the C compiler; the use of the C
programming language to generate specific assembly language instructions.

##### Course Objective
After the course students should understand: the architecture of a RISC, virtual memory computer; C
and assembly language programming; macros; the form of assembly language generated by a compiler; and
the interface to an operating system.
