# SPARCstation 5

SPARCstation 5 or SS5 (code-named Aurora) is a workstation introduced by Sun Microsystems in March 1994. It is based on the sun4m architecture, and is enclosed in a pizza-box chassis.

Sun rolled out the SPARCstation 5 for US$3,995

The SPARCstation 5 may incorporate one of the following processors: 70, 85, or 110 MHz Sun Microsystems microSPARC-II. The SPARCstation 5 has no MBus and thus is limited to use as a single-processor machine.

The SPARCstation 5 has eight DSIMM slots for memory expansion. Slots can be filled individually with either 8 MB or 32 MB modules giving a maximum of 256 MB memory.

The SPARCstation 5 can hold two internal 80-pin SCA, single-ended, fast-narrow SCSI drives, a SCSI CD-ROM drive, and a floppy. It also supports external SCSI devices. There is no IDE/ATAPI support.

The following operating systems will run on a SPARCstation 5:

* SunOS 4.1.3_U1B onwards
* Solaris 2.3 Edition II to Solaris 9
* Linux - Most distributions of Linux have compatibility issues with TurboSPARC variants
* MirBSD/sparc
* NetBSD/sparc
* OpenBSD/sparc
* NeXTSTEP
* OPENSTEP/Mach

#### Sun-4 architecture
The Sun-4 architecture refers to the VME-based architecture described above and used in the Sun 4/100, 4/200, SPARCserver 300 and SPARCserver 400 ranges. Sun-4 support was included in SunOS 3.2 onwards and Solaris 2.1 to 2.4. OpenBSD and NetBSD also will run on the Sun-4 architecture families.

Sun-4m
Originally a multiprocessor Sun-4 variant, based on the MBus processor module bus introduced in the SPARCserver 600MP series. The Sun-4m architecture later also encompassed non-MBus uniprocessor systems such as the SPARCstation 5, utilizing SPARC V8-architecture processors. Supported by SunOS 4.1.2 onwards and Solaris 2.1 to 9. SPARCserver 600MP support was dropped after Solaris 2.5.1.

#### SunOS

SunOS is a Unix-branded operating system developed by Sun Microsystems for their workstation and server computer systems. The SunOS name is usually only used to refer to versions 1.0 to 4.1.4, which were based on BSD, while versions 5.0 and later are based on UNIX System V Release 4, and are marketed under the brand name Solaris.

SunOS 4.1.3_U1B	
Feb 1994	Earliest release for which Y2K compliance patches were available.

SunOS 4.1.4	
Nov 1994	Last release of SunOS 4

SunOS 4.1.2 introduced support for Sun's first sun4m-architecture multiprocessor machines (the SPARCserver 600MP series); since it had only a single lock for the kernel, only one CPU at a time could execute in the kernel.

The last release of SunOS 4 was 4.1.4 (Solaris 1.1.2) in 1994. The sun4, sun4c, and sun4m architectures were supported in 4.1.4; sun4d was not supported.

Sun continued to ship SunOS 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 until December 27, 1998; they were supported until September 30, 2003.

#### "SunOS" and "Solaris"

In 1987, AT&T Corporation and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix flavors on the market at that time: BSD (including many of the features then unique to SunOS), System V, and Xenix. This would become System V Release 4 (SVR4).

On September 4, 1991, Sun announced that its next major OS release would switch from its BSD-derived source base to one based on SVR4. Although the internal designation of this release would be SunOS 5, from this point Sun began using the marketing name Solaris.

SunOS 4.1.1 was rebranded Solaris 1.0; SunOS 5.0 would be considered a part of Solaris 2.0. SunOS 4.1.x micro versions continued to be released through 1994, and each of these was also given a Solaris 1.x equivalent name.
